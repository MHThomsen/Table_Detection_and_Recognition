# 02456 Deep Learning - Table Detection using Faster R-CNN

* To showcase the model and it's predictions, please open en 02456_Showcase notebook. 
* Please note that the requirements.txt file is NOT complete. The file only showcases the important libraries where we have special dependencies for this project. For all other libs, like numpy, up-to date installation will work.  
* Many of the .py files in this folder are Torchvision 0.8.1 implementation, which we have had to alter to fit with the custom RPN implementation
